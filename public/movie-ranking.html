<h1>The Best Movies According to Ben</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Howl's Moving Castle</h3>
<p>My wife and I love this movie, visually it's stunning and the characters are just so loveable.</p>
<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
<p>Hiccup's ingenuity and willingness to test boundries makes him a great role model for children and adults.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>Heath Ledgers performance as the Joker is beyond creepy and really makes you feel the insanity that is the character.</p>
