<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Ben Schwendiman grew up in Idaho Falls, Idaho. He has always been a creative, he could often be caught doodling and coloring. His imagination knew no limits, he and his friends were always out making potions, fighting bad guys, even creating stop motion videos.</p>

<p>For the last 7 years Ben was an entreprenuer, blacksmith, and teacher running his own blacksmith school. But as happens so often in the business world his company couldn't stay afloat and had to close. Now he is studying to become a web developer and he's loving it.</p>

<p>Ben's future aspirations are to make enough money from coding to support his family, save as much as he can, and take plenty of family trips.</p>
